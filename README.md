### Project Overview
---

This exploratory and explanatory data analysis project, focused on Delhi, India, from 2015 to 2020, aims to identify the major air pollutants, analyze their trends over the years, and assess their impact on the Air Quality Index (AQI) Bucket. The study also examines vehicle activities, specifically the number of vehicles in the state over time, to determine if there is a correlation between vehicular presence, elevated pollution levels, and their subsequent effect on the AQI.

### Datasets
1. [Air Quality Index (AQI) Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india/data) AQI readings for major air pollutants in cities of India from 2015 to 2020
2. [Vehicle data:](https://data.opencity.in/dataset/delhi-vehicle-registrations-data/resource/c9c2925f-4442-48ee-bacf-543d69931493?view_id=a730e71e-9937-413e-a4b6-6cd87a872c4c) Total number of vechiles in Delhi from 2006 to 2022

### Tool and Libraries 
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Methods and Analysis
- Calculate the AQI and evaluate the AQI Bucket using a defined function 
- Determine the major air pollutant(s) by generating a correlation heatmap to pinpoint pollutants with the strongest correlation to the AQI values
- Visually assess the influence of the pollutant with the strongest correlation on the distribution of AQI Bucket categories
-  Examine the impact of vehcile numbers on the major pollutant(s) over the years 


### Results/Findings
1. The major air pollutant in Delhi, India from 2015 to 2020 were Particulate Matter 2.5 and 10 (PM2.5 and PM10)
2. There is a consistent pattern between the mean particulate matter levels and the percentage increase of automobiles from 2015 to 2020

### Conclusion
The analysis of data from 2015 to 2020 and [relevant literature](https://doi.org/10.4103/0970-0218.106617) emphasizes the significant impact of vehicular activities on Delhi's air quality. Vehicular activities, [including emissions and the dispersion of road dust](https://cerca.iitd.ac.in/uploads/Reports/1576211826iitk.pdf) due to the high volume of vehicles navigating unpaved roads, contribute to high levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.
