# Delhi-Vehicle-AQI

## Project Overview
---

This data analysis project focused on Delhi, India from 2015 to 2020 aims to determine the major air pollutant(s), its effect on the Air Quality Index (AQI) Bucket, explore the trend of the major air pollutant(s) over the yearsâ€”study vehicle activities in Delhi and establish vehicular activities as the cause of high levels of pollutants in the air and the impact on the AQI.

### Datasets
1. [Air Quality Index (AQI) Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india/data) AQI readings for major air pollutants in cities of India from 2015 to 2020
2. [Vehicle data:](https://data.opencity.in/dataset/delhi-vehicle-registrations-data/resource/c9c2925f-4442-48ee-bacf-543d69931493?view_id=a730e71e-9937-413e-a4b6-6cd87a872c4c) Total nunmber of vechiles in Delhi from 2006 to 2022

### Tool and Libraries 
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Methods and Analysis
- Calculate the AQI and evaluate the AQI Bucket using a defined function 
- Determine the major air pollutant(s) by generating a correlation heatmap to pinpoint pollutants with the strongest correlation to the AQI values
- Visually assess the influence of the pollutant with the strongest correlation on the distribution of AQI Bucket categories
-  Examine the impact of vehcile numbers on the major pollutant(s) over the years 


### Results/Findings
1. The major air pollutant in Delhi, India from 2015 to 2020 were Particulate Matter 2.5 and 10 (PM2.5 and PM10)
2. There is a consistent pattern between the mean particulate matter levels and the percentage increase of automobiles from 2015 to 2020

### Conclusion
The analysis of data from 2015 to 2020 and [relevant literature](https://doi.org/10.4103/0970-0218.106617) emphasizes the significant impact of vehicular activities on Delhi's air quality. Vehicular activities, [including emissions and the dispersion of road dust](https://cerca.iitd.ac.in/uploads/Reports/1576211826iitk.pdf) due to the high volume of vehicles navigating unpaved roads, contribute to high levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.
